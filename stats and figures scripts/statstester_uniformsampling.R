# Script for calculating various statistical parameters of the two uniform
# sampling model-derived "relative slope difference" results sets. These
# include checking for normality by plotting histograms, plotting Q-Q graphs,
# and using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Also runs one-sample t-tests and calculates
# means, medians, standard deviaitons, SEMs and interquartile ranges for each set.
